We're going to start with this as the basic char siu pork and build up from there. I think this one is going to take a bit of experimentation to get acceptable. Inspired by the blog 'Woks of Life' initially. Ingredients - 2 to 3 pounds | Pork tenderloin | See notes for alt. Marinade - 1/4 cup | Sugar - 2 teaspoons | Salt - 1/2 teaspoon | Chinese five spice - 1/4 teaspoon | White pepper - 1 tablespoon | Shaoxing rice wine - 1 tablespoon | Soy sauce - 1 tablespoon | Hoisin sauce - 1/2 teaspoon | Seasame oil - 2 teaspoons | Fancy molasses | sub. Honey if none - 3 cloves | garlic | finely minced Glaze - 3 tablespoons | marinade - 2 tablespoons | maltose | sub. Honey if none - 1 tablespoon | hot water Instructions Notes Pork tenderloin is a contentious choice. If you have access a fattier piece of pork (shoulder) butt will likely do better. Fat is flavor afterall. Fancy molasses is a sweet molasses made from pure sugarcane juice.","title":"Char Siu Pork"},{"location":"recipes/char-siu-pork/#ingredients","text":"- 2 to 3 pounds | Pork tenderloin | See notes for alt.","title":"Ingredients"},{"location":"recipes/char-siu-pork/#marinade","text":"- 1/4 cup | Sugar - 2 teaspoons | Salt - 1/2 teaspoon | Chinese five spice - 1/4 teaspoon | White pepper - 1 tablespoon | Shaoxing rice wine - 1 tablespoon | Soy sauce - 1 tablespoon | Hoisin sauce - 1/2 teaspoon | Seasame oil - 2 teaspoons | Fancy molasses | sub.
