> Here's a recipe inspired by 'A Taste of Aloha: A Collection of Recipes from the Junior League of Honolulu,' a book put together in 1983 to raise money for the Junior League. This is a dish served cold. Also, while I say this is Hawaiian, this is probably better described as a home recipe from an all-American mom. 

## Ingredients 

    - 3 pounds | Large Shrimp | peeled and deveined 

## Marinade

    - 1 1/2 cups     | Mayonnaise  
    - 6 tablespoons  | Ketchup 
    - 3 tablespoons  | Worcestershire sauce 
    - 5 large cloves | Garlic | crushed
    - 3 tablespoons  | Capers | drained
    - 1 tablespoon   | Dill weed 
    - 3 tablespoons  | Dill pickle juice 

## Instructions

Cook cleaned shrimp in boiling salted water for 5 to 10 minutes or until bright pink and cooked through. Once cooked, take the shrimp out of the water and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process. 

Mix the marinade ingredients. Marinate the cooled shrimp in marinade. 

Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours. Stir every 12 hours.
