> A recipe that is still in development. We're going to start with 
this as the basic char siu pork and build up from there. I think this one is going to take a bit of experimentation to get acceptable. Inspired by the blog 'Woks of Life' initially. 

## Ingredients 

    - 2 to 3 pounds | Pork tenderloin | See notes for alt.
## Marinade

    - 1/4 cup | Sugar
    - 2 teaspoons | Salt
    - 1/2 teaspoon | Chinese five spice
    - 1/4 teaspoon | White pepper
    - 1 tablespoon | Shaoxing rice wine
    - 1 tablespoon | Soy sauce
    - 1 tablespoon | Hoisin sauce
    - 1/2 teaspoon | Seasame oil
    - 2 teaspoons | Fancy molasses | sub. Honey if none
    - 3 cloves | garlic | finely minced
    
## Glaze
    - 3 tablespoons | marinade
    - 2 tablespoons | maltose | sub. Honey if none
    - 1 tablespoon | hot water

## Instructions

### Notes

* Pork tenderloin is a contentious choice. If you have access a fattier piece of pork (shoulder) butt will likely do better. Fat is flavor afterall. 

* Fancy molasses is a sweet molasses made from pure sugarcane juice.
